alpha do not use. this is just a test how to use monkey c and develop garmin apps with the sdk.

garmin only allows 2 data columns under the navigation map on their bike computers.
with this custom data field you can display 3 columns. additionally each column can be configured to switch automatically every 3 seconds and show different data.

the vertical lines display the current heart rate zones and power zones.
